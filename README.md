<br>

#### Services
<hr>

<strong>Large screen</strong>

- Displayed on screens equal or greater than: ≥992px

<br>

<strong>Medium screen</strong>

- Displayed on screens smaller than: <768px
- The three columns are split into three rows stacking one below the other. This is due to the columns (and therefore content) becoming too narrows and stretching the page with the long paragraph of text

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684870617/services-md_fee75p.jpg">

<br>

Future development:

- A row which consists of three columns of equal width

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684876265/current-projects_av2mzo.jpg">
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684878062/finished-projects_gv8jjh.jpg">

<br>

- Displayed on screens smaller than: <576px

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684876265/current-projects-sm_brf5on.jpg">

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684878065/create-new-project_dvstxz.jpg">

<br>

Future development:
 
- At the moment, the buttons are there for presentation purposes. However, once the appropriate services pages are added onto the website, the buttons will redirect the user to the respective service page they've requested to see
