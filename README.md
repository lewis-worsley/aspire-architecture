<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684869533/stats_n6t3rf.jpg">

<br>

#### Services
<hr>

<strong>Large screen</strong>

- Displayed on screens equal or greater than: ≥992px
- A row which consists of three columns of equal width to communicate to readers they're of equal importance, particulary as the site needs to communicate with mulitple audiences

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684870617/services_lutnib.jpg">

<br>

<strong>Medium screen</strong>

- Displayed on screens smaller than: <768px
- The three columns are split into three rows stacking one below the other. This is due to the columns (and therefore content) becoming too narrows and stretching the page with the long paragraph of text

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684870617/services-md_fee75p.jpg">

<br>

Future development: 

- At the moment, the buttons are there for presentation purposes. However, once the appropriate pages are added onto the website, the buttons will redirect the user to the respective service page they've requested to see

<br>

#### Call to Action (CTA)
<hr>

- A row which consists of three columns of equal width
- The first project (left column) being the most recent project uploaded
- Projects section doesn't follow the services section breakpoint as there is less description (especially when 'excerpt' is added to the site), meaning design isn't negatively hampered

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684876265/current-projects_av2mzo.jpg">
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684878062/finished-projects_gv8jjh.jpg">

<br>

<strong>Small screen</strong>

- Displayed on screens smaller than: <576px

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684876265/current-projects-sm_brf5on.jpg">

<br>

- After a new project is created, the project appears in the left column (top on mobile/tablets) and shifts all projects further down the pecking order (queryset) - whichever project was displaying in the right column (bottom on mobile/tablets) is subsequently removed to make way for the new project that has been uploaded. A visible representation is provided by comparing the respective images above and below this paragraph

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684878065/create-new-project_dvstxz.jpg">

<br>

Future development:
 
- At the moment, the buttons are there for presentation purposes. However, once the appropriate services pages are added onto the website, the buttons will redirect the user to the respective service page they've requested to see
- The projects currently display the description of each published project, but in future an excerpt would be implemented with a set character limit to ensure design remains consistent and easy to follow

<br>

<br>

## Testing
<hr>
Throughout the build of the website, but more so after the structure and contents of the page was added, Google Dev-tools was used extensively to validate new ideas, fix errors, unearth solutions, and ensure consistency with the design and user experience across various devices by ensuring the website was responsive.

<br>

### Am I Responsive
<hr>

To check to see if the website was responsive across different types of devices, the URL was entered into https://ui.dev/amiresponsive/. The website appeared as expected across each device. The image snippet in the intro section of this README.md is provided by https://ui.dev/amiresponsive/.

<br>

### Testing on devices
<hr>

During development of the website, the code was written and tested on HP EliteBook 840 G5 14" and on the LG 21.5" monitor - most of the screenshots in this README.md file have been provided by these two screens.

Google Dev-tools was used extensively throughout the process, as it provides instant feedback on appearence and responsivity across elements and dimensions.

After development, the website has been tested on the following devices:

- HP EliteBook 840 G5 14" - Chrome and Microsoft Edge
- LG 21.5" monitor 
- iPhone XS Max - Chrome and Safari

<br>

<strong>iPhone XS Max</strong>

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684950522/iphone-xs-max_rx2ccd.png">

<br>

### Testing links
<hr>

<strong>Results:</strong>

- Navbar works as expected, the only options which do not redirect users are 'Studio' and 'Press' (this is expected)
- The buttons in the services and projects section do not redirect users to another page (this is expected)
- The form in the contact section works as expected and upon submission the form takes the user to https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/
- The telephone and email links in the footer work as expected
- The social media icons in the footer work as expected

Future development:

- Create pages for the buttons and links which have been referenced on the points above

<br>

<br>

## Deployment
<hr>

The project was deployed on Heroku, and uses ElephantSQL for its database.

<br>

### ElephantSQL
<hr>

A managed postgres database was created with ElephantSQL (https://www.elephantsql.com/)

Steps to create a database:

- Select 'Create New Instance
- Give a database a 'name' and select a plan. Proceed to next step by clicking 'Select Region'
- Choose your region and then click 'Review'
- Once created, click on your recently created instance
- Copy the database URL - this will be used to connect the database to the project. It will needed to be inserted in the GitHub repository under 'settings.py' and in Heroku

<br>

### Heroku
<hr>

Steps to deploy:

- Create a new app in Heroku
- Select "New" and "Create new app"
- Name the new app and choose a region
- In the 'Settings' tab, navigate to 'Reveal Config Vars'
- Create a new envionment variable called "DATABASE_URL' and paste the ElephantSQL database URL into the corresponding field
- Create another environment variable called "SECRET_KEY" and make up a random secret key or use https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ to make one 

### env.py
<hr>

- In your project, create an env.py file in the root directory and ensure the code appears as:
 
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684931467/env.py_olyqds.jpg">

- The ElephantSQL database URL should be pasted for the DATABASE_URL value
- The secret key should be pasted for the SECRET_KEY value

### settings.py
<hr>

- In settings.py file, add the following library:
    - from pathlib import Path
    - import os
    - import dj_database_url

    - if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
        - import env

- Link the DATABASES value to the env.py file with the following code: 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684931970/databases-value_oycroc.jpg">

- Now the app models can be migrated to the new database by executing the following code in the command line:
    - python3 manage.py migrate

### Cloudinary
<hr>

To manage static and media files for the project by using a cloud service: https://cloudinary.com/

- From the account tab, copy the 'cloudinary URL' and paste it into the env.py as the CLOUDINARY_URL value
- In Heroku, add the CLOUDINARY_URL variable into Config Vars
- In heroku, Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to Heroku Config Vars with the value of 1 (<strong></strong>needs to be removed before final deployment!</strong>)

- Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps in 'settings.py' file in your project:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684934120/cloudinary-installed-apps_auxjaw.jpg">

- For Cloudinary to operate, the static files should appear as follows

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684934120/static-media_femknc.jpg">
<br>

(<strong>note: order is important</strong>)

<br>

### Remaining steps
<hr>

- Link file to the templates directory in Heroku. Place under the BASE_DIR line. It should resemble as follows:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684934836/base-dir_yv3f3w.jpg">

- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array. It should resemble as follows:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dys7tcjln/image/upload/v1684934836/templates-dir_uh8wm3.jpg">
<br>

- Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS. It should appear as:
    - ALLOWED_HOSTS=["project_name.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]
- Create 3 new folders on top level directory:
    - media
    - static
    - templates
- Create a Procfile on the top level directory:
    - Procfile
- In Procfile, add the following code:
    - web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi
- Save all files
- In the terminal, add, commit and push changes to GitHub
- Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from Heroku Config Vars

<br>

#### Final deployment in Heroku
<hr>

- Click on "Deploy" and select your deploy method and repository.
- Click "Connect" on selected repository.
- Either choose "Enable Automatic Deploys" or "Deploy Branch" in the manual deploy section.
- Heroku will now deploy the site.

<br>

## Languages
<hr>
The coding languages and frameworks used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap

<br>

## Software
<hr>
The design for Aspire Architecture was created via the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite; more specifically I used:

- Abobe Photoshop
- Adobe InDesign
- Adobe Illustrator

Through using these three tools, I was able to design the logo, produce a layout, design prototypes, and compress web images by either reducing image size or quality.

<br>

## Media
<hr>

The logo for Aspire Architecture was designed by myself, Lewis Worsley.
