#### Footer
<hr>

- The footer indicates the end of the page - this is replicated on each page on the website.
- Social media icons (provided by Font Awesome) are included on the footer to encourage the visitor to engage with the brand. 
- For accessibilily, each social link has an aria-label attribute
- When a user clicks on one of the social media icons, the browser redirects the visitor to a new tab. This prevents users from leaving the website
- The company details have the appropriate telephone and email links to make user experience friendly. Creating a sense of 'ease-of-use' on the website will evoke positive emotions and help encourage visitors to communicate with the brand

For future development: the footer is to include links to high-priorty pages and office locations.
