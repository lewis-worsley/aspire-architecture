#### Services
<hr>

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

For future development: none of the buttons in this section direct the user elsewhere on the website. At the moment, the buttons are there for presentation purposes. However, once the appropriate services pages are added onto the website, the buttons will redirect the user to the respective service page they've requested to see.

#### Footer
<hr>

- The footer indicates the end of the page - this is replicated on each page on the website.
- Social media icons (provided by Font Awesome) are included on the footer to encourage the visitor to engage with the brand. 
- For accessibilily, each social link has an aria-label attribute
- When a user clicks on one of the social media icons, the browser redirects the visitor to a new tab. This prevents users from leaving the website
- The company details have the appropriate telephone and email links to make user experience friendly. Creating a sense of 'ease-of-use' on the website will evoke positive emotions and help encourage visitors to communicate with the brand

For future development: the footer is to include links to high-priorty pages and office locations.

## Testing
<hr>
Throughout the build of the website, but more so after the structure and contents of the page was added, Google Dev-tools was used extensively to validate new ideas, fix errors, unearth solutions, and ensure consistency with the design and user experience across various devices by ensuring the website was responsive.

<br>

### Am I Responsive
<hr>

To check to see if the website was responsive across different types of devices, the URL was entered into https://ui.dev/amiresponsive/. The website it appeared as expected across each device. The image snippet in the intro section of this README.md is provided by https://ui.dev/amiresponsive/

<br>

### Testing on devices
<hr>

During development of the website, the code was written and tested on HP EliteBook 840 G5 14". 

Google Dev-tools was used extensively throughout the process, as it provides instant feedback on appearence and responsivity across elements and dimensions.

After development, the website has been tested on the following devices:

- HP EliteBook 840 G5 14" - Chrome and Microsoft Edge
- LG 21.5" monitor 
- iPhone XS Max - Chrome and Safari
